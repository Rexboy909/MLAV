# MLAV
### Music and Lyric Audio Visualizer
##### MLAV will be a music player that dynamically displays the lyrics of the song playing and features visualizers for the songs.
##### The program will support uncompressed audio, like .wav and .flac files, as well as other formats, like mp3, aac, and ogg.
##### The application will render different audio visualizers for the current song, and will try to incorporate lyrics into the visualizer.
